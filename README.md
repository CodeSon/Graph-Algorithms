# This program reads data stored in a file and creates a directed graph. 
- It takes two nodes from the main method and checks whether the nodes are connected by a path, and will print the path if there is one.
- Path finding is carried out using Breadth first search algorithm

# The second program reads file and takes each node into a string array, then finds the shortest path using BFS with the source
of the path and destination to be found in the main class with each node having an adjacency list built with all other connected nodes.
